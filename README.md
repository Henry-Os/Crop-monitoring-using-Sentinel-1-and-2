SAR and optial satellite data for crop monitoring
Aim: Integrate SAR data for crop monitoring in places of unfavorable weather.

Objectives:
1. SAR polarimetric parameters (16) such as span and entropy are used to estimate optical vegetation indices (5) such as NDVI and NDRE.

2. Tests the sensitivity of the SAR-calibrated optical vegetation indices (VIs) with crop productivity data such as LAI and chl.

3. Uses the SAR calibrated VIs to predict crop yield.
